    Editing <i>What kind of pet do you have?</i></h1>
  <thread-editor-stub text="I'm curious to know what kind of pets the forum users have. I thought this could be a nice way to get to know each other a little better, so I'll start!

My dog is a five month old Italian mastiff (Cane Corso). Since I got him from Barcelona I thought a Spanish name would be suitable, and I named him Don Jefe, or Jefe for short (which means &quot;boss man&quot;).

Jefe is a cute, little beast who eats 1.5 kg raw meat every day. He love to fart, snore and play.

Here's Jefe with his Instagram hat and sqeaky ball ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰
