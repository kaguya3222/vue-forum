      I'm curious to know what kind of pets the forum users have. I thought this could be a nice way to get to know each other a little better, so I'll start!

      My dog is a five month old Italian mastiff (Cane Corso). Since I got him from Barcelona I thought a Spanish name would be suitable, and I named him Don Jefe, or Jefe for short (which means "boss man").

      Jefe is a cute, little beast who eats 1.5 kg raw meat every day. He love to fart, snore and play.

      Here's Jefe with his Instagram hat and sqeaky ball ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰
